/*
In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

    Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Dates are always objects
    Maths are always objects
    Regular expressions are always objects
    Arrays are always objects
    Functions are always objects
    Objects are always objects

All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

JavaScript Primitives
A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.
A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.
JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:

    string
    number
    boolean
    null
    undefined

Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and therefore cannot be changed).
